# C Programming Assignments and Projects

Welcome to my collection of C programming assignments and projects, completed as part of my BCA coursework at Midnapore College. This repository contains well-organized code categorized by semester and subject, designed to demonstrate my understanding of core C programming concepts, data structures, and operating system fundamentals.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **COLLEGE ASSIGNMENT 1st SEM**  
  Basic C programs covering variables, control structures, loops, arrays, strings, functions, and file handling.

- **COLLEGE ASSIGNMENT 2nd SEM (DS)**  
  Programs related to Data Structures including:
  - Arrays and Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Sorting and Searching algorithms

- **COLLEGE ASSIGNMENT 2nd SEM (OS)**  
  C implementations based on Operating System concepts:
  - Process scheduling algorithms
  - Memory management techniques
  - File management and system calls

- **C-Programs**  
  A mix of additional C programs and practice exercises.
